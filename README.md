Thibault Helsmoortel's Java Utilities Library

This library is created to make Java programming even easier. It does this by adding often used formulas of all kind 
as well as other useful classes. The library was initially created for Thibault's personal use.

Feel free to use this library, though do not (re)distribute it without any written permission (ask permission by contacting me via hhtp://www.thibaulthelsmoortel.be).

All code written by Thibault Helsmoortel.
